Description: R data pipelines commonly require reading and writing data to versioned 
    directories. Each directory might correspond to one step of a multi-step process,
    where that version corresponds to particular settings for that step and a chain of
    previous steps that each have their own versions. This package creates a configuration
    object that makes it easy to read and write versioned data, based on YAML
    configuration files loaded and saved to each versioned folder.
